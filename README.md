# Notepad--
-----------------
A cross-platform (near) clone of Windows Notepad written in JavaFX.

## Installing Notepad--
Notepad-- is easiest to use as the included .jar file. In this repository go to:
```
/out/artifacts/Notepad/Notepad.jar
```
You can run that directly from the command line by simply typing:
```
~/$ java -jar Notepad.jar
```
I plan to package it for each platform eventually, but for now you can either run the jar or build the source yourself.
(Which compiles to a .jar anyways.)

## Contributing to Notepad--
If you want to contribute to Notepad-- just fork this repository, make your changes and submit a pull request. I didn't
make this to have tons of features. I even removed some of the features from the Windows Notepad because I didn't need
them. I'm open to adding more to make it an exact clone or to fix any bugs, but I don't want to turn it into Notepad++.
That already exists so there is no need to create another one.

If you want to do that then by all means feel free to use this as a starting point. It is licensed under the Apache
